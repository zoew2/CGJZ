The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
